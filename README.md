# Top Knotch Solutions

Hello & welcome to the TKS Repo! This is my first attempt to create a web application for a painting business. My intention is to develop a static application for Robert V. Davis' business, Top Knotch Solutions. This will allow users to more easily contact Rob and showcase his work in a clean and organized manner that's visually more appealing than his facebook business page. Eventually, Rob will have the capability of modifying his application and tracking his campaigns via a dashboard that congregates his data.
