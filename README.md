# Top Knotch Solutions

Hello & welcome to the TKS Repo! This is my first attempt to create a web application for a painting business. My intention is to develop a static application for Robert V. Davis' business, Top Knotch Solutions by implementing the following technologies: 

    HTML
    CSS
    JS
    Bootstrap
    PHP
    MySQL or Postgres
    Apache
    Linux

For hosting the LAMP stack, I intend to have the project on GitHub using pages, Netlify, Heroku, or AWS utilizing a bucket (Still figuring this part out).

Front End: 
    
    will be built using HTML5, CSS3, JS and Bootstrap 5 for a responsive design. 

Back End:
    
    will be built with PHP and SQL. 

Web Server:

    will run Linux using Apache to serve the pages.

    1.) Digital Brand Promotion:
        
        a.) Brand awareness campaign landing page - 
            Traffic from Social & Search
