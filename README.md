# Top Knotch Solutions

Hello & welcome to the TKS Repo! This is my first attempt to create a web application for a painting business. My intention is to develop a static application for his business implementing the following technologies: 

    HTML
    CSS
    JS
    Bootstrap
    PHP
    MySQL or Postgres
    Apache
    Linux

For hosting the LAMP stack, I intend to have the project on GitHub using pages, Netlify, Heroku, or AWS utilizing a bucket (Still figuring this part out).

The front end will be built using HTML5, CSS3, JS and Bootstrap 5 for a responsive design. 

The back end will be built with PHP and SQL. 

The web server will run Linux using Apache to serve the pages.
